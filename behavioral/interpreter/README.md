# Interpreter pattern using Python
Implementation of Interpreter Design Pattern according to the task from 'Design Patterns in Python' course
https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-python/

I made the task more difficult in order to follow a full structure of Interpreter Design Pattern.

# Task
Calculate the expression
Rules:
* Numbers could be an only integer
* Supported operators: +, -
* Braces not supported
* Variables could be defined only as single-letter (e.g. 'x')
* If a variable is used, but not defined use default value - 0
* In case of parsing failure - return error message
